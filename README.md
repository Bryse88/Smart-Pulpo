# Smart-Pulpo
Arduino Code for Maker Faire
This code uses an adafruit color sensor to take raw RGB data. 
It then compares to see what audio file shuld be used. 
The arduino type is a simple Arduino Uno Rev3. 

The other file is the code I used to teach younger kids about the basics of arduino and color sensing.
